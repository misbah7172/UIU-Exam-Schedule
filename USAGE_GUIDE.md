## What the PDF Extractor Looks For

The system searches your class registration PDF for:
- **Course Codes**: CSE251, MATH101, ENG102, etc.
- **Sections**: "Sec: A", "Section: B", etc.

It then:
- Matches these with the exam schedule
- Assigns your exam room based on your student ID
- Creates your personalized timetable

## Troubleshooting

### "No courses found in the PDF"
- Make sure you uploaded the correct class registration PDF
- The PDF should contain course codes like CSE251, MATH101
- Try the manual method instead

### "No matching courses found in exam schedule"
- Ensure you've uploaded the correct exam routine Excel file
- Check if the course codes in your PDF match the exam schedule
- Some courses might not have exams scheduled yet

### Rooms not showing correctly
- Verify your student ID is entered correctly
- Check if the exam schedule has room assignments with student ID ranges
- Some exams might not have room assignments yet

## Tips

1. **Always confirm your student ID first** before uploading the PDF
2. **Keep your PDF file** - you can use it for all exam schedules
3. **Double-check the extracted courses** before downloading
4. **You can remove courses** by clicking the X button if something is wrong
5. **View full routine** to see all exams if needed
